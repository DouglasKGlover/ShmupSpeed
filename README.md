# ShmupSpeed

ShmupSpeed is a site dedicated to clicking buttons fast. Pretty simple concept, this is a required skill for certain (mainly older) shoot-em-up video games. The ability to press buttons on an arcade stick (or any game pad really) is an important one to maximize damage as some games limit the bullets your ship can shoot only by how quickly you can press the buttons.

# Tech Stack

The site was initially built on the Symfony 3 PHP framework for a few features including a leaderboard and dynamic sharing functionality. More recently though I've stripped out the PHP side in order to host it for cheaper on a static site host (Netlify) to keep things simple.
